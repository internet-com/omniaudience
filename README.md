Blockchain block listener for transaction notifications

### Â¿How it works?

Omniaudience works by getting every block your node receives and checks if there's a transaction for a saved wallet address and then notifies to your desired endpoint.

### Installation.

This is a [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) project. So it basically is installed the same way as any meteor project. [Orion Hosting](https://orion.hosting) recommended for faster deploying.
A Mongo Server is required for production usage. You have to set the Mongo_URL Environment Variable

    MONGO_URL=mongodb://username:password@your-mongo-server-here.example.com:27015/database

### Subscribe address

To start watching and address, POST data to your server, sending an address, notifyUrl and currency code.

#### Example

```json
{
  "address": "1v5oc8QTdz4GUrvvWxGd1FaXDU62nkvRY",
  "notifyUrl": "http://omniaudience.requestcatcher.com/test",
  "currencyCode": "BTC"
}
```

Response is simple: "done"

### Delete Subscription

To delete a suscription, POST data to your server, sending an address to delete.

#### Example

```json
{
  "address": "1v5oc8QTdz4GUrvvWxGd1FaXDU62nkvRY"
}
```

Again, response is simple: "done"

### Notifications

Notifications will send you a POST request to the endpoint specified to the wallet with the following information:

```json
{
  "address": "1v5oc8QTdz4GUrvvWxGd1FaXDU62nkvRY",
  "amount": 998919,
  "confirmed": false
}
```

Amount is in satoshis format.

Basically you will get 2 notifications for every transaction. The first one is when a transactions appears on a block and a second one when the transaction has been confirmed.
